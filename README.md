Zoom Information
You will be connecting to your course via a Zoom session. The link below provides instructions on how to gain access to this Zoom session.
The Zoom experience works best with the following:
•	Two monitors are recommended (however not essential if you just have the one)
•	A good quality headset/microphone (your mobile earbuds are a great option) 
•	Webcam - required (enhances communication between the instructor and all students, and ensures an optimal classroom experience for all attendees)
It is recommended that you use the desktop client which will require you to install software on your computer (please check your administration rights / check with your IT department for help if required), as this will give you the best user experience.  However, you can choose to simply use the web client (if you don't have access to download to your computer), this option will become available when you click on the link below to join the class.

IMPORTANT - If you are joining this training session via a corporate network or device (laptop, desktop, etc.), you will require access to GitHub. Why? Restrictions on your corporate network are likely to limit access to the Labs in the course and reduce the effectiveness of the training for you. Access to GitHub will overcome this issue and ensure you receive the full training experience - please ensure you have access before joining training on day one. If you are joining the session from a private device and network, or from a DDLS campus, you will NOT require access to GitHub.
